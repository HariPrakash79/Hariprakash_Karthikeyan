Hi there, I'm Hari Karthikeyan

Data Scientist | ML Engineer | Data Systems Builder

🚀 Passionate about building scalable machine learning systems from raw data to deployment.
🎯 Focused on distributed analytics, deep learning, and production-grade ML pipelines.
🎓 MS in Data Science | University of Rochester

💡 About Me

I work at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and data engineering.

I enjoy turning large, messy datasets into structured systems that scale — whether that’s distributed Spark pipelines on AWS, deep learning models for manufacturing inspection, or graph analytics on mobility networks.

I care about:

Statistical rigor

Reproducible experiments

Scalable distributed systems

Clean, production-ready workflows

Areas of Expertise

Machine Learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyMC)
Deep Learning & Transfer Learning
Spark (PySpark, Structured Streaming)
Distributed Systems (Databricks on AWS, Delta Lake)
NLP (Regex pipelines, Transformer-based inference)
Graph Analytics & Network Modeling
MLflow & Experiment Tracking
Python | SQL | Pandas | NumPy | Streamlit

Recent Projects
🔥 Distributed Sentiment Analytics (AWS + Spark)

Built a Spark Structured Streaming pipeline on AWS-hosted Databricks to process 100K+ records using a Bronze → Silver → Gold architecture. Integrated MLflow-tracked transformer inference and Delta Lake storage for scalable sentiment analytics.

🧠 Deep Learning for Manufacturing QA

Fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetV2 on X-ray solder images, achieving ~0.80 accuracy and ~0.95 recall after threshold A/B evaluation, minimizing missed-defect risk in automated inspection workflows.

🚕 NYC Mobility Network Analysis

Modeled 100M+ NYC TLC trip records as directed spatiotemporal networks, applying Louvain clustering and centrality metrics to quantify demand redistribution following ride-hailing expansion.
