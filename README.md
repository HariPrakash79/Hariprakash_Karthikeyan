## 💡 About Me  

I’m a Data Scientist working at the intersection of machine learning, distributed systems, and production engineering.  

I build end-to-end systems from modeling and experimentation to deployment and monitoring, with a strong emphasis on statistical rigor and scalability.  

My work spans distributed Spark pipelines on AWS, deep learning systems for manufacturing inspection, and large-scale network analytics on urban mobility data.

## Recent Projects  


### 🎧 Real-Time Music Recommender System (Ongoing)  
Building an AWS + Kafka + LLM pipeline that ingests multi-source music data (50K+ tracks) into S3, normalizes it to Parquet, streams listening events through Kafka, and serves SQL-ready features via PostgreSQL for real-time personalization and conversational recommendations. [Github Repo Link](https://github.com/HariPrakash79/spotify-realtime-music-assistant)


### 🔥 Distributed Sentiment Analytics  
Built a Spark Structured Streaming pipeline on AWS-hosted Databricks processing 100K+ records using a Bronze → Silver → Gold architecture with MLflow-tracked transformer inference and Delta Lake storage. [Github Repo Link](https://github.com/HariPrakash79/Twitter_sentiment_analysis)


### 🧠 Deep Learning for Manufacturing QA  
Fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetV2 for X-ray solder defect detection, achieving ~0.80 accuracy and ~0.95 recall after threshold A/B evaluation while preventing cross-panel data leakage. [Github Repo Link](https://github.com/HariPrakash79/solder-joint-quality-prediction)


### 🚕 NYC Mobility Network Analysis  
Modeled 100M+ NYC TLC trip records as directed spatiotemporal networks, applying Louvain clustering and centrality metrics to quantify demand redistribution after ride-hailing expansion. [Github Repo Link](https://github.com/HariPrakash79/Uber_Taxi_Network_Analysis)
